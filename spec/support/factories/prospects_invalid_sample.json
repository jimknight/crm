Current process:  Powder is purchased in 60 cu. ft. bag.  Bag is hoisted over receiver bin.  Bottom of bag is cut open and contents dumped into bin.  Bin is attached atop a mix and fold auger which is ten feet long.  Powder is gravity fed into auger.  Atop the length of the auger is a 1\/8\" water line.  There are five nozzles spraying water onto the powder.  As the powder is fed up the auger the water is mixed into it to eliminate dust.  I need to also address weight.  The powder is a mineral and very fine.  The heavy tends to separate from the light and wants to come out first.  I want to eliminate this problem by thoroughly mixing everything at one time before feeding into bags.  At the end of the auger the powder is dumped into our 1.70 cu. ft. bags.  The process takes 35 seconds to fill each bag.  I would like to purchase a used mixer.  Can you help us increase production?  <BR>Thanks,<BR>Tom<BR>"
